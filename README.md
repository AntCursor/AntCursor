# About me

## Presentation 
Hi 👋, my name is Antônio, I'm currently a 15 year's old teenager 🙋, and a very proud Brazilian🇧🇷.

## My experience with software 
Currently I have no technical formation of any kind, all my experience comes from self taught, reading online books, watching videos and some programming on my old little pc.
I use GNU/Linux from the start and have a very good experience with the command line, and know languages like Python, C, Rust, Lean, Nix, x86-64 Assembly, Java and little of Lua.

I currently don't have any considerable repos on github.
