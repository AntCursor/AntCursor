# About me

## Presentation 
Hi ğŸ‘‹, my name is AntÃ´nio, I'm currently a 14 year's old teenager ğŸ™‹, and a very proud BrazilianğŸ‡§ğŸ‡·.

## My experience with software 
Currently I have no technical formation on any kind of courses, all my experience comes from self taught reading online books, watching a lot of videos and some programming on my old little pc.
I use GNU/Linux from the start and have a very good experience with the command line, and know languages like Python, C, Rust and little of Lua.

I still don't have any repo's or considerable local project
